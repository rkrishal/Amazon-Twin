  Amazon Clone Built Using React.JS & Firebase
</h1>


<p><font size="3">
  This is a clone of Amazon E-Commerce platform website built using <strong><em>React.JS</em></strong> as a Front-end & <strong><em>Firebase</em></strong> as Back-end. It's not a replica, and it     doesn't have all the features of Amazon website. it's a similar version of Amazon with my own design touch, showing my abilities in React.JS to build something advanced       like Amazon.
